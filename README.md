     ```
     Expect: `OK`

### Deployment on Render

1. **Create a Render Account**:
   Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com).

2. **Push to Git Repository**:
   Ensure all files (`main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `render.yaml`, `README.md`) are in your repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial setup for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Create a Web Service**:
   - In Render, select **New > Web Service** and connect your Git repository.
   - Render will detect `render.yaml` and configure the service automatically.

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   In Render‚Äôs dashboard (Environment section):
   - `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token (set manually for security).
   - `ADMIN_IDS`: Comma-separated Telegram user IDs for admins.
   - `BASE_URL`: Your Render app URL (e.g., `https://ebook-downloader-bot.onrender.com`).
   - `PORT`: `8080` (matches `render.yaml`).
   - Note: `PYTHON_VERSION` (3.10) is set in `render.yaml`.

5. **Deploy**:
   - Render will execute:
     - Build: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - Start: `python main.py`
   - Check Render logs for:
     ```
     Webhook set to https://ebook-downloader-bot.onrender.com/webhook/{BOT_TOKEN}
     ```
     ```
     Sent keep-alive ping
     ```

6. **Verify Webhook**:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getWebhookInfo
   ```
   Expect: `{"ok":true,"result":{"url":"https://ebook-downloader-bot.onrender.com/webhook/YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",...}}`

7. **Test Deployment**:
   - In Telegram, test:
     - `/start`, `/search Pride and Prejudice`, `/status`, `/help`, `/about`.
     - Preview books and download links.
     - Pagination and admin broadcast (if admin).
   - Verify health endpoint:
     ```bash
     curl https://ebook-downloader-bot.onrender.com/health
     ```
     Expect: `OK`
   - Monitor Render logs for errors or successful interactions.

## Usage

1. **Start the Bot**:
   - Send `/start` to receive a welcome message with available commands.

2. **Search for Books**:
   - Use `/search <book title>` (e.g., `/search The Great Gatsby`).
   - Results include title, author, year, language, format, and file size.
   - Click "‚úÖ Preview/Details" for more info or the book title for a download link.

3. **Navigate Results**:
   - Use "Next" and "Previous" buttons for additional results.

4. **Check Status**:
   - Send `/status` to view:
     - Uptime, total searches, user count, cache size.
     - Availability of Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, and Z-Library.

5. **Admin Broadcast**:
   - Admins (specified in `ADMIN_IDS`) can use `/broadcast <message>` to notify all users.
   - Limited to 1 broadcast every 5 minutes.

6. **Notes**:
   - Project Gutenberg and Internet Archive provide free, public domain books.
   - Z-Library may require an account for some downloads; check download links for details.
   - Rate limits ensure fair usage (5 searches per minute).

## Troubleshooting

- **Webhook Not Set**:
  - **Symptom**: Bot doesn‚Äôt respond; logs show ‚ÄúFailed to set webhook‚Äù.
  - **Fix**: Verify `BOT_TOKEN` and `BASE_URL` in Render‚Äôs environment variables. Ensure `BASE_URL` is correct (Render assigns this on deployment).
  - **Manual Fix**:
    ```bash
    curl -F "url=https://ebook-downloader-bot.onrender.com/webhook/YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook
    ```

- **Health Check Failure**:
  - **Symptom**: Render reports service as unhealthy.
  - **Fix**: Ensure `curl https://ebook-downloader-bot.onrender.com/health` returns ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. Check logs for server errors. Verify `aiohttp.web==3.9.5` in `requirements.txt`.

- **Z-Library Search Failures**:
  - **Symptom**: Z-Library results are empty or fail.
  - **Fix**: The `zLibrarySearch` class uses `https://z-lib.is`, which may change. Update `self.base_url` in `main.py` to the current Z-Library domain.
  - **Test Locally**:
    ```python
    import asyncio
    from main import downloader
    async def test_zlib():
        results = await downloader.zlibrary.search_books("Pride and Prejudice")
        print(results)
    asyncio.run(test_zlib())
    ```

- **Render Free Tier Spindown**:
  - **Symptom**: Bot responds slowly after inactivity.
  - **Fix**: The `keep_alive` function pings `/health` every 5 minutes to prevent spindown. If delays persist, upgrade to Render‚Äôs `starter` plan for dedicated resources.

- **Build Failure**:
  - **Symptom**: Render build fails (e.g., dependency errors).
  - **Fix**: Check logs for missing packages or Python version mismatches. Ensure `requirements.txt` matches the provided version and `PYTHON_VERSION: 3.10` in `render.yaml`.

- **Bot Not Responding**:
  - **Symptom**: Commands like `/start` or `/search` don‚Äôt work.
  - **Fix**: Check Render logs for errors (e.g., invalid `BOT_TOKEN`, port conflicts). Restart the service in Render. Verify webhook setup.

### Integration with Other Files

- **main.py**: The `README` references `main.py` as the primary script, explaining its webhook-based operation and `/health` endpoint.
- **render.yaml**: Instructions align with the provided `render.yaml`, including environment variables (`BOT_TOKEN`, `BASE_URL`, `PORT`, `ADMIN_IDS`) and deployment settings.
- **requirements.txt**: The `README` lists dependencies exactly as in `requirements.txt` for transparency.
- **webhook.py**: Not included in the project structure, as it was renamed to `main.py`. The `README` avoids confusion by focusing on the current setup.

### Deployment Verification

To ensure the `README` instructions work, follow these steps after updating your repository:

1. **Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add README.md main.py requirements.txt render.yaml
   git commit -m "Update README and project files for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render Deployment**:
   - Confirm Render detects `render.yaml` and sets up the service.
   - Set environment variables in Render‚Äôs dashboard as listed in the `README`.
   - Check logs for ‚ÄúWebhook set to...‚Äù and ‚ÄúSent keep-alive ping‚Äù.

3. **Test**:
   - Verify webhook:
     ```bash
     curl https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getWebhookInfo
     ```
   - Test bot commands in Telegram.
   - Check health endpoint:
     ```bash
     curl https://ebook-downloader-bot.onrender.com/health
     ```

### Troubleshooting (from README)

If issues arise, refer to the `Troubleshooting` section in the `README`. Common fixes include:
- **Webhook**: Manually set with `curl` if automatic setup fails.
- **Z-Library**: Update `base_url` in `main.py` if the domain changes.
- **Render**: Check logs for build or runtime errors; ensure `requirements.txt` is correct.
